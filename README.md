RESTful Chessgame
=================
This project was developed as part of my diploma thesis at the Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft (<https://www.htw-dresden.de/startseite.html>). 
The written elaboration can be found under ``doc/diploma`` and was created with the Latex thesis template developed by Matthias Pospiech. (<http://www.matthiaspospiech.de/latex/vorlagen/allgemein/>)

The project can be separated by two modules which are developed with Kotlin. Gradle serves as build tool. 
As compilation target, the client has JavaScript and the server JVM.

Requirements
---------------
* Java 8 JRE (to start the project)
* Java 8 SDK (to build the Project)


Getting Started
---------------
Pull repository:

``git clone git@github.com:GagaMen/chessgame.git``

Move into project folder:

``cd chessgame``

Build the project:

``./gradlew build``

Start server with client as static resources:

``java -jar server/build/libs/chessgame-server-1.0.0.war``

Server
------
Build Server:
``./gradlew :server:build``

### Run Server
* with gradle: ``./gradlew :server:bootRun``
* with jar: ``java -jar server/build/libs/chessgame-server-1.0.0.jar`` (without static resources)
* with war: ``java -jar server/build/libs/chessgame-server-1.0.0.war`` (with static resources -> client module)

### Server Configuration
The Server starts on port ``8080`` by default. If you want to change the port override the ``server.port`` config entry 
in the ``application.yml`` file, which is located under ``src/main/resources``. 
You have to rebuild the project if you overwrites the configuration.

### Content Negotiation
The server offers three options to handle content negotiation:
1.  Suffix Strategy
    * ``http:localhost:8080/players.json`` 
    * ``http:localhost:8080/players.xml``
    
2. Parameter Strategy
    * ``http:localhost:8080/players?mediaType=json``
    * ``http:localhost:8080/players?mediaType=xml``
    
3. Accept Header Strategy
    * Accept Header: ``application/json``
    * Accept Header: ``application/xml``

Client
------
Build Client:
``./gradlew :client:build``

### Run Client
All what you have to do is to copy the ``dist`` folder, which is created after run the build task, to your web server.

### Client Configuration
The client config ``configuration.json`` is located under ``src/main/resources/config``. Here you can overwrite
the default server domain, if you want to implement your own for example or if you want to use another server.
The default server domain is ``http://localhost:8080``, which is the same url than the server. If you chance the server 
port don't forgot to adjust the ``serverRootUrl`` in the client config.
