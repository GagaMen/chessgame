RESTful Chessgame
=================
This project was developed as part of my diploma thesis at the Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft (<https://www.htw-dresden.de/startseite.html>). 
The written elaboration can be found under ``doc/diploma`` and was created with the Latex thesis template developed by Matthias Pospiech. (<http://www.matthiaspospiech.de/latex/vorlagen/allgemein/>)

The project can be separated by two modules which are developed with Kotlin. Gradle serves as build tool. 
As compilation target, the client has JavaScript and the server JVM.

Requirements
---------------
* Java 8 JRE (to start the project)
* Java 8 SDK (to build the Project)


Getting Started
---------------
Pull repository:

``git clone git@github.com:GagaMen/chessgame.git``

Move into project folder:

``cd chessgame``

Build the project:

``./gradlew build``

Start server with client as static resources:

``java -jar server/build/libs/chessgame-server-1.0.0.war``

Or use docker compose:
* ``docker-compose build``
* ``docker-compose up -d``

Server
------
Build Server:
``./gradlew :server:build``

### Run Server
* with gradle: ``./gradlew :server:bootRun``
* with jar: ``java -jar server/build/libs/chessgame-server-1.0.0.jar`` (without static resources)
* with war: ``java -jar server/build/libs/chessgame-server-1.0.0.war`` (with static resources -> client module)

#### with Docker
* ``docker-compose build`` (only the first time and after updates necessary)
* ``docker-compose up -d`` (use your docker ip with port ``8080`` by default)
  * If you want to start the server without the client you have to change the ``service.chess-server.build.dockerfile``
  config entry to ``dockerfile-chess-server``
* ``docker-compose down`` (shutdown the containers)

### Server Configuration
The Server starts on port ``8080`` by default. If you want to change the port override the ``server.port`` config entry 
in the ``application.yml`` file, which is located under ``src/main/resources``. 
You have to rebuild the project if you overwrites the configuration.
> If you are using docker and you change the default spring port, you have to change also the ``services.chess-server.ports`` 
config entry in the ``docker-compose.yml`` file. For example if the new port is ``8000`` the ``services.chess-server.ports``
entry have to be ``8000:8080``.

### Content Negotiation
The server offers three options to handle content negotiation:
1.  Suffix Strategy
    * ``http:localhost:8080/players.json`` 
    * ``http:localhost:8080/players.xml``
    
2. Parameter Strategy
    * ``http:localhost:8080/players?mediaType=json``
    * ``http:localhost:8080/players?mediaType=xml``
    
3. Accept Header Strategy
    * Accept Header: ``application/json``
    * Accept Header: ``application/xml``
    
> see also <http://www.baeldung.com/spring-mvc-content-negotiation-json-xml>

### Documentation
Visit the document page <https://gagamen.github.io/chessgame/>

Alternative you can build the javadoc with the following task: ``./gradlew :server:dokka``.
The files are generated in the ``doc/javadoc`` folder. 

AI Server
---------
If you want to start the AI server without docker on an different server for example, then clone the git project from
<https://github.com/ncksllvn/chess-api> and follow the instruction of this repository.
After setup the ai server you have to change the ``app.aiServerRootUrl`` config entry in the ``application.yml`` file, 
which is located under ``src/main/resources`` and rebuild the project.
> The default value of this config entry is ``http://chess-ai:5000`` which is intended for the docker setup

### Run Ai Server with Docker
* ``docker build -t chess-ai -f dockerfile-chess-ai .``
* ``docker run --name chess-ai -d -p 5000:5000 chess-ai``

After that you can request your default docker ip with ``docker-machine ip default`` and open that with the port ``5000``
in your browser. You can call ``docker stop chess-ai`` to stop and ``docker start chess-ai`` to restart the container.

Client
------
Build Client:
``./gradlew :client:build``

### Run Client
All what you have to do is to copy the ``dist`` folder, which is created after run the build task, to your web server.

#### with Docker
* ``docker build -t chess-client -f dockerfile-chess-client .``
* ``docker run --name chess-client -d -p 8080:80 chess-client``

After that you can request your default docker ip with ``docker-machine ip default`` and open that with the port ``8080``
in your browser. You can call ``docker stop chess-client`` to stop and ``docker start chess-client`` to restart the container.

> Don't forget to change the ``serverRootUrl`` if you ara using the client separately. (see [Client Configuration](#client-configuration))

If you pull updates you have to remove first the existing container with the ``docker rm chess-client`` command and then you 
have to repeat the first two commands above.

### Client Configuration
* ``{ "useWindowLocation": true, "serverRootUrl": "" }``

The client config ``configuration.json`` is located under ``src/main/resources/config``. Here you can overwrite
the server domain, if you want to implement your own for example or if you want to use another server.
By default the server use the window location to set the server root url. If you want to override the server root url 
set the value ``useWindowLocation`` to ``false`` and the ``serverRootUrl`` to your own url.
